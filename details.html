                    You will need to show ID to vote in your state. 
                    Acceptable forms of valid ID include: 
                    voter registration confirmation documents; 
                    a valid state driver's license (expired or unexpired), 
                    a valid United States passport, or any other identification issued by the the state, 
                    one of its political subdivisions, or the United States; 
                    any valid student identification card issued by any institution of higher education located in any state or territory of the United States; 
                    any valid employee identification card containing a photograph of the voter and issued by an employer of the voter in the ordinary course of the employer's business; 
                    tribal enrollment or other tribal photo ID; state Voter Photo ID card; or a copy of a current utility bill, 
                    bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows the name and address of the voter.
                    Voters without ID: If you are unable to provide ID, you are required to sign a statement that you are the registered voter you claim to be in order to cast a ballot. 
                    A voter who does not show one of the required forms of identification and does not complete or sign the statement shall be offered a provisional ballot. After completing the provisional ballot, 
                    you will be given written instructions from the election officials on how to submit a copy of your ID so that your vote can be counted. You will have until noon on the Friday following the election to deliver a copy of the ID to the local electoral board.

                    Besides the names on your ballot, you may be able to write in names of other candidates. Most states let you write in votes for president, U.S. senator, and U.S. representative. They may also allow write-in votes for governor and other state offices.  
                    But writing in a name doesn't mean that vote will count. Many states require write-in candidates file paperwork before the election. 

                    Voters can also vote prior to Election Day arriving. The early voting period runs from Friday, September 18, 2020 to Saturday, October 31, 2020, but dates and hours may vary based on where you live.
